# Fees and revenue

Astrolab draws revenue from the following income streams:

- Performance fees: 15-22%, depending on the crate and the strategy.
- Kickback fees from bridges
- Farming the PCV. Learn more about it in the [flywheel section!](/tokenomics/flywheel.html)

Revenue is allocated between insurance staking and PCV accumulation, and the ratio is determined through governance voting.
