# Fees

Astrolab draws revenue from fees and kickbacks from bridges. Revenue is allocated between insurance staking and PCV accumulation ($AURA, for instance), and the ratio is determined through governance voting.

The fee range is 5-22% for performance fees and 0-2% for management fees. They are decided per Crate basis, depending on risk profile, profitability and the amount of maintenance needed.

Astrolab's goal is to find a balance between profitability for the depositors, competitiveness, and revenue for the protocol. Here is a modelization of Astrolab's revenue, depending on the fee structure:
