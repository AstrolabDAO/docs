# Governance

This section is a work in progress and will be updated before mainnet launch.

Formal discussions about the protocol's current state, development decisions and future strategy are held on https://commonwealth.im/.

Decisions are executed by the protocols' multisig. Members are the following:

```
- [Member] - [address]
- [Member] - [address]
- [Member] - [address]
- [Member] - [address]
- [Member] - [address]

```
