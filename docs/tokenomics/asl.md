# The $ASL token

The $ASL token is used to secure the protocol, distribute its revenue to holders and ensure the safety of the staked capital. The $ASL token enables holders to influence the protocolâ€™s development through governance votes and discussions. Safety is a core value for Astrolab, and the tokenomics are designed to foster a safe and profitable evolution for the protocol.

The $ASL utility is threefold:

- [Protocol insurance](/safu/insurance.html)
- [Revenue sharing](/tokenomics/fees.html)
- [Protocol governance](/tokenomics/governance.html)

The $ASL token is allocated the following way:

```

19%     Private investors
18%     Treasury
15%     Astrolab team
