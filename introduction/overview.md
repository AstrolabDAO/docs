# What is Astrolab Finance?

Astrolab Finance is a omnichain yield aggregator that allows its users deposit their assets in pools located on multiple chains, in one click. Bridging and routing and compounding are done automatically. Astrolab helps you to allocate your capital efficiently and safely in a challenging multichain defi environment.

Astrolab achieves this by leveraging state-of-the-art cross-chain messaging technologies, allowing communication between defi protocols on different chains. Because everything is done on-chain in a decentralized way, users remain in full control of their capital and can deposit and withdraw anytime they want, in a permissionless and trustless manner. One of the best features of Defi is composability, and Astrolab is being built with the long term goal to fully merge with the EVM ecosystem.

# Astrolab's Crates

Crates are the main product of Astrolab. They correspond to multichain, multipool vaults allocating assets accross EVM chains. They can come with different underlying assets: USDC, ETH, FRAX, etc., and with different risk profiles, to allow users manage their exposure. 

After depositing their assets, users get a Crate Token, which acts like a proof-of-deposit, and which can be redeemed anytime for its underlying value. Crate tokens follow the ERC4626 standard and can be used as a collateral in other defi protocols by users wanting to improve their capital efficiency.

# What is $ASL?

$ASL is the protocol token for Astrolab Finance. The $ASL token is used to secure the protocol and ensure the safety of the staked capital. 

By staking $ASL, users can insure Crates while earning a share of the protocol's fee. If one of the Crates insured was to experiment an unexpected loss of funds, a share of the $ASL staked would be set aside to compensate the affected Crate. Once done, locked $ASL is returned to their holders.

This mechanism creates a snowball effect, where $ASL holders help improve the safety of the protocol, while users get costless insurance and lower risk profile for their investment. **Astrolab strongly believes that good governance comes with skin in the game and should align with the protocol's values - profitability and safety**.
