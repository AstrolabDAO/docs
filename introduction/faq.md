### How can I contribute?

Astrolab being an on-chain community, there is always a need for help from members. The main domains are the following:

- Socials: spread enthousiasm about Astrolab.
- Yield hunting: Report new yield opportunities that may be interesting to farm
- Developing: Write strategies for Crates
- Auditing: audit protocols and strategies.

### Astrolab relies on automation for some parts of its protocol. Is it centralized?

In order to reduce to the maximum the costs for the users, the protocol uses bulk sending at certain intervals. Automation is done with on-chain services, such as Chainlink Keepers or Gelato Network. 

Some more complex monitoring, used to ensure the protocol's fluidity and safety may be needed. It is planned to use at some point decentralized computation services for those, such as Internet Computer's canisters. All priviledged addresses are validated by governance.

### Where does the name "Crate" come from?

Crates are Astrolab's multichain, multistrategy vaults. Given that the concept was a notable evolution from the classic single-strategy vaults, such as the ones yield optimizers operate, Astrolab's team thought using a new name would be wise. Crates fit nicely with the "sailing" theme of Astrolab (which is a sailing instrument), and bears the idea of composability.

### Is Astrolab audited?

You can check the [audits](/safu/audits.html) page if you like to know more about it.
