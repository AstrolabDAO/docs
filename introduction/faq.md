### Where does the name "Crate" come from?

Crates are Astrolab's multichain, multistrategy vaults. Given that the concept was a notable evolution from the classic single-strategy vaults, such as the ones yield optimizers operate, Astrolab's team thought using a new name would be wise. Crates fit nicely with the "sailing" theme of Astrolab (which is a sailing instrument), and bear the idea of composability.
