# Emergency stop

If a vulnerability is detected in a contract, due to external reports, auditing or malevolent actions detected on-chain, the first line of defense is to pause contract interactions to protect protocol funds. Multisig and voting are not appropriate responses because the vulnerability may warrant an immediate response, and multisig holders may be unavailable upon detection.

Astrolab’s contracts, therefore, contain a fuse function that allows for pausing the specific parts of the protocol that may be at risk. To mitigate the availability problem, multiple wallets will be allowed to pull the trigger. Restarting the paused contract must be done through multisig, thereby ensuring a thorough investigation of the threat.

The wallets listed below have permission to pause Astrolab’s contracts. If you find or become aware of any issues, please contact the wallet holders immediately.
