# Why?

Defi bears a risk. According to [Chainanalysis](https://archive.ph/sAs2j), 3.2 B$ were stolen in 2021, and the trend is, sadly, increasing.

An increased amount of bad actors have emerged, some being opportunistic, others being [very organized](https://archive.ph/Gd2MA). Protocols storing large amounts of value soon become a target, and such threats mandate strong risk management. Hacks are devastating for users and devs alike, avoiding them and mitigating their effects should be on the top of the list for every defi protocol. 

If defi wants to stay free, it needs to be safe.

## How?

Most protocols adopt optimistic measures against hacks, such as audits, decentralized governance, bounties and smart contract monitoring. However, this may not be enough, as bugs can always stay undetected for a long period of time, or third parties may be faulty at some point. A balanced stance toward smart contract risk should implement optimistic, but also pessimistic measures: how to make sure an exploit doesn't threaten the protocol and its users?

A classic solution also comes in the form of insurance, already well-known in centralized finance. In the ultra-competitive race for the highest nominal yields, insurance costs aren't very popular - only 2% of the protocols are currently insured according to [Bitcoinist](https://archive.ph/FWl0O). 

Insurance protocols themselves face problems evaluating risks in an industry speed-running in a few months the last hundred years of financial innovations, without regulations or law enforcement possible. As protocols grow, so do insurance costs, and the lack of scalability becomes soon a problem.

In Astrolab's case, given that Crates interacts with many different protocols, it's hard for an outsider to evaluate risk properly and on the go. 

Astrolab's solution is thus to insure itself and use the $ASL token to protect the protocol.
