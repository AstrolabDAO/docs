# Why?

Crypto is risky, Defi is risky. According to [Chainanalysis](https://archive.ph/sAs2j), 3.2 B$ were stolen in 2021, and the trend is, sadly, increasing.

An increased amount of bad actors have emerged, some being opportunistic, others being [very organized](https://archive.ph/Gd2MA). Protocols storing large amounts of value soon become a target, and such threats mandates strong risk management. Hacks are devastating for users and devs alike, avoiding them and mitigating their effects should be on the top of the list for every defi protocol.

Risk management is done well if planned in advance, but a realistic defi community should also plan for the worst. What happens in case of loss of funds?

A classic solution also comes in the form of insurance, already well-known in centralized finance. In the ultracompetitive race for the highest nominal yields, insurance costs aren't very popular - only 2% of the protocols are currently insured according to [Bitcoinist](https://archive.ph/FWl0O). 

Insurance protocols themselves face problems evaluating risks in an industry speed-running in a few months the last hundred years of financial innovations, without regulations or law enforcement possible. As protocols grow, so does insurance costs, and the lack of scalability becomes soon a problem.

In Astrolab's case, given that Crates interacts with many different protocols, it's hard for an outsider to evaluate risk properly and on the go. Astrolab's solution is thus to use the protocol's revenue to insure itself.
