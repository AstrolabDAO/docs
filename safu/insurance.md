# Insuring the Crates

Crates are insured by $ASL stakers, who can choose which risk level they want to cover, and earn a share of the performance fees generated by the underlying assets. If an unexpected loss happens, a share of the tokens staked are locked, and the fees associated will go to the affected crate, until it has been compensated, or a predefined amount of time has been spent. 

This mechanism protects the $ASL value and the staker's holdings by avoiding to auction tokens on the market like Aave does. Because the affected crate will now get a new "free" income stream, its APR will increase, making it more attractive to new users. Compensation isn't done immediately, however it's scalable by ensuring the losses have a way to be recovered over time whatever the amount of the losses. Given that Crates allocate the funds to multiple pools, risk is sharded and should prevent a total loss of funds.

Events covered are the following:
- Oracle malfunctionning
- Bad debt on one the Crate's strategies
- Bug, or malfunction of the Crate or of one the Crate's strategies
- Theft of funds locked in the contract

Parameters used to compute the compensation schedule and the events covered are defined by governance, to keep the balance between staking incentives and protocol de-risking.
