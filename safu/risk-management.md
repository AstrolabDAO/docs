# Managing risk

Astrolab's smart contract risks can be divided into two categories:

- Core contracts risks
- Third-party risks

For each category, Astrolab's goal is to get the maximum involvement from the community to set the protocol on the safest path possible.

## Core contract risks

Astrolab's core contracts are used to process the accounting for the Crates, route assets to farming pools, receive and communicate with other chains. Those contracts are very important and a failure bears systemic risk for the whole protocol. Hence, lots of resources need to be spent ensuring they're safe and any exploit attempt is swiftly mitigated. This means having audits from third-parties, as well as other defensive measures such as upgradability and smart contract monitoring to pause everything if a threat is detected. 

Governance can vote to order new audits and decide to fund measures such as bug bounties and external insurance.

## Farming risks

Given that Astrolab's core product consists in yield aggregation, the protocol is exposed to third-party risk when it deposits assets into farming pools. Internal auditing and due diligence should be done before adding a new pool to a Crate's portfolio, and enough diversification should allow reducing exposure. 

Each pool is given a grade, which would be used to define the general portfolio of each Crate. A "conservative" Crate shouldn't deposit into a "risky" pool, and an "aggressive" Crate should limit its exposure to it, as long as it isn't considered safe enough.

Smart contract risk assessment needs human intervention and can't be fully automated. The core team and the community can thus step in to assess each pool's risk and help define the best portfolio for each Crate. 

Given that stakers bear the protocol's risk, governance involvement is greatly incentivized to reduce the potential downside. A team of internal auditors can be set up to review strategies, as well as a network of watchers who could warn Astrolab's in case of a risk increase in a farmed protocol.
